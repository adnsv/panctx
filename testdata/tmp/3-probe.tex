\chapter[ultrasonic-probe]{Ultrasonic Probe}

The probe consists of a multiple coax cable and an ultrasonic transducer. This
is the most critical part of F1. A malfunctioning or damaged probe may not
provide accurate measurements. Here are the major parts of the probe:

\section[usage]{Usage}

The front face of the transducer is very fragile. Check that there is no dust,
grease, or any other foreign particles between the front face of the probe and
the delay line before mounting the delay. The delay and the coupler are the only
replaceable parts on the probe. Please do not try to disassemble the protective
case, take out the matrix transducer, or detach the cable from the protective
case as this will damage the probe beyond repair.

\section[cleaning-and-maintenance]{Cleaning and Maintenance}

\startitemize
\item
Clean the front face and the thread of the transducer. If possible, use
isopropyl alcohol, dry using an air jet
\item
Clean the face of the delay which will be in contact with the front face of
the transducer and the collar using the same technique, dry with an air jet
\item
For operation, a very thin layer of a standard ultrasonic gel should be
applied between the transducer front face and the delay to provide sufficient
acoustical contact
\item
Make sure the gel is clean and there are no air bubbles in it
\item
During storage or transportation, the front face of the transducer must be
protected with the delay or with a protection cap
\item
When storing the transducer for long periods of time (longer than a month),
make sure there is no gel left on the surface of the transducer
\item
Under normal operating conditions, the gel layer should be replaced each
month; In a warm and dry environment the gel should be replaced more often

Ensure the delay line is face up before attaching the coupler
