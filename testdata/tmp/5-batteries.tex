The remaining battery life can be checked both on the device, using the power
manager, as well as with the power meter located on the battery itself. The
power meter is activated by pressing the Power Test button. The number of LED
lights indicates the power level of the battery pack.

\section[battery-charging]{Battery Charging}

When the device is connected to an AC adapter, any inserted batteries will
automatically begin to recharge. While the batteries are charging, the Battery
Charge icon on the Indicator panel will be active after 6–12 seconds. When the
batteries are fully charged, the Battery Charge icon will turn off.

\startNOTE{Note:}
When not in use for a month or more, fully charge the battery prior to
storing.
\stopNOTE

When RSWA is turned off, a fully discharged battery will take about 3 hours to
recharge. If RSWA is turned on and is not in suspend mode, it will take about
4–5 hours to recharge the battery.

\section[when-to-replace-the-battery]{When to Replace the Battery}

Over time, the batteries’ capacity gradually decreases. It is recommended that
the batteries be replaced when they begin to store significantly less charge.
Only use replacement batteries approved by Tessonics. The use of unapproved
batteries may cause damage to the device and void the warranty.

\startWARNING{Warning:}
Danger of explosion if battery is incorrectly replaced. Dispose of
used batteries according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
