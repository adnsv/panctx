\chapter[overview]{Overview}

The base F1 unit consists of a Windows-based tablet PC with installed software.
The probe has a 52-element matrix transducer which connects to an internal DSP
board located within the RSWA. Two removable batteries provide up to 9â€“12 hours
of run time when disconnected from a power source. A charger/AC adapter provides
power for simultaneous device operation and battery charging. The device is
designed with a ruggedized case to provide protection against shock and
mechanical damage.
