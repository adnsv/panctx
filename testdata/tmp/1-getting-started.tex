\section[damage-in-transit]{Damage in Transit}

Inspect the unit thoroughly and immediately upon receipt, for evidence of
external or internal damage that may have occurred during shipment. Immediately
notify the carrier making the delivery of any damage, since the carrier is
usually liable for damage in shipment. Preserve packing materials, waybills, and
other shipping documentation in order to claim any damages. After notifying the
carrier, contact Tessonics to receive assistance in the damage claims, and
provide replacement equipment, if necessary. Please note that your shipping
container is re-usable and may be used in the future when returning the unit for
recalibration or repair.

\section[setting-up]{Setting Up}

Check the list of supplied items. Verify that you have received all items listed
on the RSWA Packing List. If anything is missing, please contact Tessonics Sales
and Service office.

Connect the A/C adapter to the device and charge the batteries for at least 4
hours before using it for the first time.
